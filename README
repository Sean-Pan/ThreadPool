ThreadPool
==========

This will be a very small, simple library providing concurrency with minimal
effort.

** ThreadPool is now DEPRECATED!!! **

Use ThreadPuddle instead. It's faster and does essentially the same thing.

TODO

Create build.xml file to create javadocs, compile code, run the tests, and pack
this wee bit of code into a jar.
